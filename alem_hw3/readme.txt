1a. I've placed the calculations in the submission
b."cl_ho.png" contains <E> and <E^2> as a function of temperature through a Monte Carlo simulation that random walks through phase space of a classical electron. The step has been adjusted to get an acceptance probability around 50%.
c. See 1b

2a. Same as 1a
b."qm_ho.png" contains <E> and <E^2> as a function of temperature through a Monte Carlo simulation that random walks through the Energy eignstates of a quantum  electron in a 1D harmonic oscillator.
c. See 2b
d. Specific Heat, C = dE/T = k_B. If we look at "hc.png" we can see that the resultant data fluctuates around our k_B = 1. However at very small values of T where hw >> (k_B * T) this relation does not hold and quantum effects are seen.
